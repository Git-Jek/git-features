GitHub Features

Github is one of the most popular resources for developers to share code and work on projects together. It is free, easy to use, and has become central in the movement toward open-source software.

What  you can do with Github:
    * Collaborate with colleagues.
    * Post code documentation.
    * Discuss issues in a community.
    * Connect your work to project management tools.

By default, Github names the default branch as "main" in any new repository. The first two options are not default branch names. "Master" is a default branch name in Git, not Github. However, you can change the default branch in Github settings.
